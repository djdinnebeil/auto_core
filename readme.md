# Auto Core for Windows 11
Auto Core is a C++ utility designed to streamline task execution on Windows 11 systems. Auto Core is a specialized keyboard manager for the numpad keys, providing support for quick taskbar access, music player integration, journaling inspiration and helper, and automating text insertion.

## Main Features and Core Architecture
- **Numpad Keyboard Manager:** Monitors and intercepts numpad and additional keys to carry out tasks.
- **System Console Window:** Uses the system console to display output or request input.
- **Automated Text Insertion:** Automates text insertion into the active textbox by utilizing the system clipboard and 'ctrl + v' paste shortcut.
- **Taskbar PowerShell:** Simplifies quick taskbar access by sending keyboard events for the winkey shortcuts (winkey + #0-9) and provides additional support for further taskbar productivity.
- **Music Player Integration:** Supports music player integration for iTunes and Spotify.
- **Journaling Support:** Automates titling and file creation of journaling documents.
- **Creative Writing Inspiration:** Follows the 'dice roll' method to generate random numbers or prompts for journaling inspiration.
- **Browser-based Local File Management:** Runs a local server to facilitate browser-based local file access.
- **System Maintenance:** Supports maintenance tasks, including emptying the recycle bin and logging system wake events.

## Project Architecture
Auto Core is designed with a modular component architecture that separates the main system controller from specialized component executables.

The components are stored in the 'core' directory.

The components are:
- dash_x - for runtime configuration. 
- itunes - for interacting with iTunes.
- server - for a local server to allow local file access through a browser.
- slash - for deleting files and folders
- sp - for interacting with Spotify.
- wake - for tracking system activity, such as waking up.

To differentiate component scripts from main scripts, the following notation is used:
- _x - this indicates an external component
- _c - this indicates a class for the component
- _t - this indicates a thread for the component

The main component will have:
sp.ixx
while the external component will have:
sp_x.ixx

The components talk to each other through pipes.

Modules that are shared between components are marked by adding a \hardlink tag.

## Folder Structure
- assets - Graphical resources.
- bin - Compiled executables.
- build - CMakeLists.txt.
- config - Configuration files.
- core - Core components.
- dash - Runtime configuration.
- dist - Dedicated folder for building.
- docs - Documentation.
- import - Main program modules.
- lib - External libraries.
- link - User-custom strings.
- log - Debugging and operational logging.
- server - Local server setup files.
- shared - Project-built shared libraries and shared modules.
- src - Source code files.
- star - User-specific data like login tokens and journal databases.
- sun - Taskbar shortcut.
- tests - Testing scripts.
- tools - Utilities for expanding functionality.
- utils - Utility and helper scripts, such as creating a new journaling database.
- visual - Visual Studio-related files, such as .sln and .pdb.

## Config Folder

clock.ini - the end_of_day can be adjusted, such as 00:59 vs. 24:59
logger.ini - allows for enhanced debugging by sending any log statement to the console window
runtime.ini - allows for runtime configuration and logging / debugging runtime mappings 
runtime_map.ini - has the runtime mappings set and is also available in the dash folder
server.ini - controls server related settings, like port 
star.ini - has journal related settings
taskbar.ini - a list of the user's first 10 elements on the taskbar

## Dash Folder

dash_x.ini - this is a hard link of dash_x.ixx, located in the 'import' folder
runtime_map.ini - this is a hard link of runtime_map.ini from 'config'

By opening dash_x.ini with runtime_map.ini allows for IntelliSense autocomplete


## Modules Overview
For a detailed description of each module, please refer to the [Doxygen documentation](./docs/html/files.html).

## Requirements
- Windows 11
- C++ Compiler (supporting C++23)
- Development environment (e.g., Visual Studio)
- Basic knowledge of C++

## Installation and Setup
Installation and usage of this software require knowledge of C++. Please note that this project has not yet been developed for distribution.

## Changelog
Auto Core originally began as a Python project named Auto Song. This name was inspired by the primary use case for formatting the currently playing song.

When the project was ported to C++, the program name was changed to Auto Core to reflect the greater level of system control and precision-tuning offered by C++.

With the upgrade to C++23 modules, Auto Core branched off into two projects: the Auto Core project and the Visual Core project. The Auto Core project is focused on improving and fine-tuning the program core, while the Visual Core project is dedicated to developing and optimizing the separate components, such as music player or cloud components.
